            Hey! My name is Medet. I am a full-stack engineer based in Toronto I
            have been working as a freelance developer since 20019. I’ve always
            been someone who has both a creative and a logical side. When I
            discovered web design in college, I realized it would be the perfect
            fit. I could use my creative side to design and my logical side to
            code. As a bonus, being both designer and developer allows me to
            make sure no detail is lost in translation.

            I love working with small businesses I specialize in creating sites
            for individuals and small businesses. You shouldn’t have to settle
            for cheap solutions or generic templates. I provide custom designs
            at affordable prices. Frequently your website is the first
            impression your customers will get, so make sure it’s a good one.
            Since my time is split between a few different things, I’m not able
            to take on every project I’d like to, but I'm always looking for fun
            work. Take a look at my portfolio below, if you think I’d be a good
            match send me an <a href="mailto:kenenbayev@gmail.com">email</a>.
